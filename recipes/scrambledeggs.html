        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Many months ago, while preparing some breakfast (scrambled eggs), I was thinking that I absolutely did not know how other people cook scrambled eggs. Okay, I understand that some readers think, “Who cares!” But sometimes a thought like that will not go away, and I knew that I’d best do something about it. I did some reading about eggs at breakfast and then read a ton of scrambled egg recipes. In the kitchen I tried recipe after recipe to ‘up my scrambled egg game.’ To be candid, most of the recipes were awful….or was it my execution? I became a driven person, and realized I would have to find my own way.</p>
        <p>My goal was to make life changing scrambled eggs: moist, creamy, and fluffy. Days turned into weeks and weeks into months but in the end I reached the Holy Grail. It might sound a little dramatic (yeah, you are probably right) but if you follow my irrefutable rules for making scrambled eggs you may even end up concluding that I understated my result.</p>
